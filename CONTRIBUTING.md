# Idea for a new feature?

Submit an issue requesting it or better yet, submit a PR implementing it.

PR Rules:

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer). It's ok to push non-PSR-2 code, but know that [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) will convert it after the merge. 

# Discovered a bug?

**Step 1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/DoDSoftware/DynamicFieldHintsForBackpack/issues).** Please include:
- (A) what you did
- (B) what you expected to happen
- (C) what actually happened 
- (D) what have you already tried to fix it?

**Step 2. Submit a PR.** 
If you have a solution for the issue and want to help, you can submit a Pull Request. Tell us you are willing to do that. It takes a little more time from you, but:
- your fix is guaranteed to be merged a lot faster;
- you'll not just be helping yourself and the maintainers of this package, you'd be helping other developers that use it;

If you've never submitted a PR before, don't worry, it's not that difficult. Read [this tutoral](https://mattstauffer.co/blog/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-github-project-using-your-own-fork) and the rules above. I promise, you'll enjoy sending PRs after a while :-)

**Happy coding**!
